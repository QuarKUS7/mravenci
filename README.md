# Mravenci in Go

A classic card strategy game (originally created by Miroslav Němeček in 2002). The object of the game is to build a castle 100 meters high or destroy an opponent's castle. To attack the enemy and build your own castle you will be using the cards that you randomly assign to the game. The cards are divided into three parts - magic, military, construction.
